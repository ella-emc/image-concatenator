 # image_concatenator

 One day, I had to scan documents in legal size on my printer. The problem was my printer can only scan papers of size smaller than Letter or A4. 
 I couldn't scan a document in legal without having to scan the upper and lower portions, cropping the lower, and stitching together the two portions to form a single image. This problem wouldn't leave me. I thought the toil was okay for one- or two-page documents, but if I had to do that for a 20-page document, the time it'll take me to crop and stitch the two pictures would be a lot. 

 Hence, this program came to life.
